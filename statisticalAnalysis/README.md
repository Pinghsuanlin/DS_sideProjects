# Projects:
## 1. Harris vs Trump 2024 Election Prediction: 
The project aimed to simulate the 2024 U.S. Presidential Election using Bayesian methodology while incorporating polling data, past 2020 election results and uncertainty modeling. The goal was to forecast electoral vote (EV) distributions and visualize state-by-state probabilities.

### Approach & Methodology
1. Data Collection & Processing
  * Polling Data Scraping: 

    * Used `BeautifulSoup`, `requests` to scrape the latest state-level polling from [FiveThirtyEight](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/polls/president-general/).
    * Addressed HTML structural variations (eg. those having "More" dropdown toggle) and standardize Democratic candidate (Biden or other candidates as Harris).
  * 
  * 
* 2020 election result and polling data to forecast 2024 possible result, allowing 1% baseline uncertainty.
* Packages: , `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`,
