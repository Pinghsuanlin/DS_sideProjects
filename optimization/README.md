# Project 1. Pricing Optimization to Maximum Revenue
* File: `pricingOptimize.ipynb`
#### Project Goal
The project goal is to pinpoint critical features that would affect price through Bayesian Model. And to give the optimal price per important feature combination list and therefore the maximum revenue based on estimated demand.
#### Approaches
* Baysian Analysis, Markove Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the posterior distribution of base price, coefficient and noise.
#### Key Findings
* How features affect price (the target):
