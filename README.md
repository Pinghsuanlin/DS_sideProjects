# PythonScopedSkills

Here include some of my work applying data analytics and modeling skills to real-time project. Python and a bit of R are the languages mainly used. </br>

* In `stock_timeSeries` folder, I utilized ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet and additive model to play around yahoo finance stock price or sales data from open source. I also used LOWESS Regression fitting model on time series data points for forecast with 95% confidence interval.
* In `statisticalAnalysis` folder, I utilized Bayesian methodology with baseline uncertainty to predict 2024 US presidential election. Web scraping and regex techniques are used to access past 2020 election and most recent state-by-state polling data.
