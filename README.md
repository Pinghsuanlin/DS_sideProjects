# Data Science Side Projects

Here include some of my work applying data analytics and modeling skills to real-time projects. `Pytho`n and  `R` are the 2 languages mainly used. </br>

* In `stock_timeSeries` folder, I utilized ARIMA, LSTM, Prophet and additive model to play around yahoo finance stock price or sales data from open source. I also used LOWESS Regression fitting model on time series data points for forecast with 95% confidence interval.
* In `statisticalAnalysis` folder, I utilized Bayesian methodology with baseline uncertainty to predict 2024 US presidential election. Web scraping and regex techniques are used to access past 2020 election and most recent state-by-state polling data.
* In `optimization` folder, I did a few projects to find the optimal price, explore resource & inventory allocation.
  * Appraoches: KNN-Nearest Clustering, Bayesian Modeling (MCMC), Jupyter Widget, Feature Engingeer and Label Encoding
* In `algoTrading` folder, I played with different trading stratgies with regression, classification models, and used backtesting to evaluate model and trading performance.
